The code was developed as part of my MSc Thesis in Data Science

The thesis focuses on the development and comparison of predictive algorithms for a state-of-the-art nZEB smart building and metered data produced by its sensors and advanced monitoring systems. In particular, this involves energy load consumption as well as weather data which are used to develop, train, and evaluate Machine Learning (ML) models. Various ML algorithms and methodologies, as well as combinations thereof, are explored and put to the test, each with its unique characteristics, in order to produce a robust approach for One-Step-Ahead Energy Load Forecasting (OSA-ELF). The effect of exogenous parameters is assessed, and comparisons are made between the different methods tested on both variating portions of the training dataset but also on new unseen data with similar properties and characteristics.
